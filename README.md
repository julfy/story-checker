Will periodically check the list of web novels and send a notification email in case of update.

Really, anything-checker, if provided with a link and a parser.

Usage:

`./sc.py` - to run once and initialize the history 

`(./sc.py -d <email> &)` - to run in loop and detach the process

`./up_n_restart.sh` - fetch updates and restart the checker loop
